# Visual-Healthcare-Insights-Python-EDA-Power-BI-Dashboards


## 📌 Project Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover key insights into patient admissions, medical conditions, treatment outcomes, and hospital performance. By combining Python for data preparation and cleaning with Power BI for interactive dashboards, the project aims to support healthcare administrators in making data-driven operational and clinical decisions.

## 📌 Project Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🩺 The Healthcare Data Analysis and Visualization Project involves working with a multi-sheet Excel dataset containing patient details, hospital information, doctor records, and patient visit data. The project workflow starts with merging and cleaning the data using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Key data cleaning steps included handling missing values, standardizing text data, mapping admission type codes, calculating patient length of stay, and identifying high billing cases.

After preparing a clean and integrated dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed in Python to validate data distributions and detect anomalies. The prepared dataset was then visualized in Power BI, where a series of interactive dashboards were built to deliver actionable insights.

The dashboards created include:

🔍 **Overview Dashboard** : Patient Admissions Summary: Visualizing patient admission counts, age distribution, gender splits, and admission trends.

🏥 **Medical Condition & Outcome Analysis** : Analyzing the frequency of medical conditions, treatment outcomes, and recovery rates.

💵 **Billing & Insurance Analysis** : Tracking billing amounts, insurance coverage patterns, and flagging high-cost cases.

🧑‍⚕️ **Doctor & Hospital Performance** : Evaluating doctor-wise and hospital-wise patient outcomes, admissions, and billing performance.

📅 **Time-Based Analysis** : Examining trends over time including admissions, discharges, and length of stay patterns.

This project demonstrates how Python-based data engineering can seamlessly integrate with BI tools like Power BI to deliver healthcare insights that improve operational efficiency and patient care decisions.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📏 Calculates Length of Stay for each patient.

- 💸 Flags patients with High Billing Amounts.

- 🔢 Maps Admission Types to numeric codes for analysis.

- 📊 Performs EDA using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

- 📈 Builds Power BI dashboards for dynamic visual insights.
